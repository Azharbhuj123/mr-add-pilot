    <div class="inner_term">
        <div class="container">
            <p>These Terms of Service and the conditions listed below apply to Mr. Adpilot Ventures Inc., <a href="https://mradpilot.com/">www.mradpilot.com</a>, and all products / services offered by Mr. Adpilot, and the conditions concerning your use of and access to the Mr. Adpilot website. By accessing, using, or downloading any materials or content from the website, you agree to follow and will be bound by all conditions included in this document. If you do not agree with these Terms you may not use our products and/or website.</p>

            <h3>ORDER CONFIRMATIONS</h3>

            <p>It is our practice to clarify and confirm orders by electronic signature. Signing the agreement binds the client to their obligations as outlined in the Billing and Payments Section included in this agreement. Receiving an email receipt does NOT constitute an agreement beyond the specified details of that receipt. You may request a receipt be mailed to you. If you do not receive a receipt by mail your emailed copy will serve as your formal receipt. We reserve the right without prior notice and at our discretion to refuse service to any customer along with access to the website by any visitor or customer should it be used inappropriately or beyond the scope of what Mr. Adpilot deems acceptable.</p>

            <h3>REVIEW SERVICE</h3>

            <p>This is a “Non-Exclusive” technology-based service and not a monthly digital marketing service. We reserve the right without prior notice and at our discretion to refuse service to any customer along with access to their review profile by any visitor or customer should it be used inappropriately or beyond the scope of what Mr. Adpilot deems acceptable.</p>

            <h3>AUTHORIZATION OF CONTENT</h3>

            <p>Customer hereby authorizes, Mr. Adpilot to use of all Customer’s logos, trademarks, Web site images, etc., for use in creating informational pages and any other uses as deemed necessary for search engine positioning and optimization. If Web site(s) requires additional textual content, Customer will provide said additional relevant text content in electronic format for the purpose of creating additional or supporting web pages. It is our best practice to “set live” any website pages, lead machine templates or landing pages on day twenty one (21) or sooner. Therefore, any and all pages will be auto published and indexed in the search engines on day 21 unless otherwise stated in writing on the contract.</p>

            <h3>PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h3>

            <p>As between you and Mr. Adpilot, with the exception, in some cases, of Submitted Materials, we own, solely and exclusively, all rights, title and interest in and to any Complimentary Marketing Microsites, all the content (including, for example, audio, photographs, illustrations, graphics, other visuals, video, copy, software, etc.), code, data and materials on the Site, and the look and feel, design, compilation and organization thereof, including, but not limited to, any copyrights, trademark rights, patent rights, database rights, moral rights and other intellectual property and proprietary rights therein. Your use of the Complimentary Marketing Microsite does not grant you ownership of any content, code, data or materials that you may access on the Site. All information you submit to Mr. Adpilot is held as confidential and is not shared with anyone other than those who will help complete the job you contract us for. All fee-based content we provide is considered a “work for hire” and all copyrights belong to you, the client, unless otherwise specified in an agreement between you and Mr. Adpilot. Mr. Adpilot agrees not to reuse or redistribute the content we provided to you as long as you have paid in full for the content. Mr. Adpilot cannot be held responsible for similar content appearing anywhere nor can we be responsible for someone else misusing your content. It is your responsibility to police the content and protect your copyrights.</p>

            <h3>EXCLUSIVITY</h3>

            <p>It is our practice to offer exclusivity to companies in the verticals we serve. Exclusive representation is not given to every client in every local market and must be qualified for. To qualify to be exclusive with Mr. Adpilot, you must spend a minimum amount on a monthly basis to our agency. Each vertical we service has a different minimum amount. An exclusive territory is a 30 mile radius around the clients primary office location/headquarters. It is our best practice to not have any clients territories overlap but in some cases it is unavoidable. In these situations, we always use our highest discretion to consider our exclusive clients needs first and make our best informed decision before taking on a new client. Mr. Adpilot has the right to refuse service to any potential client seeking to advertise in a territory that is already spoken for. Every shared client that enrolls in services with Mr. Adpilot that comes direct from a referral or affiliate partner can not be offered exclusivity and is not deemed an exclusive client. Exclusivity solely applies to clients that come to Mr. Adpilot direct and not from affiliations.</p>

            <h3>TERMINATION</h3>

            <p>Mr. Adpilot has the right to terminate your account at any time for any reason and you “the customer” or “account holder” has the right to terminate your account at any time for any reason within the guidelines of our Billing and Payments Section.</p>
            <p>The One-Time Setup Fee is offered at a discounted rate when enrolling in a 6-Month Agreement for our various services. Failure by “the customer” to adhere to the 6-Month Agreement will result in the customer being charged the difference of the discounted setup fee at the time of cancellation. For more information on the setup fee amounts, please refer to the appropriate service package on our website, or connect with your Sales Representative for a detailed explanation.</p>


            <h3>CAMPAIGN OWNERSHIP</h3>

            <p>All advertising campaigns are the property of Mr. Adpilot unless otherwise stated in an additional contract or addendum.</p>

            <h3>BILLING AND PAYMENTS</h3>

            <p>Mr. Adpilot has specific policies concerning billing and payments. ALL products offered by Mr. Adpilot fall under this scope, including but not limited to the following packages: Pay Per Click Management, Search Engine Optimization, Website Design, Reputation Management and Creative Services. Payments may be made by credit card. Set-up fees charged for account creation and establishment are not refundable. ALL accounts are put on a recurring payment cycle, unless specified otherwise by the customer at point of sale. Any client wishing to be taken off recurring status, pause an account, or cancel an account must contact Mr. Adpilot at 561-899-3043 at least 30 business days prior to the due date of their next payment. ALL payments will be billed on the same day of the month for the previous months work, unless specified otherwise by the customer at point of sale. Any declined payments will be charged a $75 late fee after being delinquent for 7 days, if after 14 days there is no communication, services will then be paused. ALL website design payments are billed an initial deposit. The final website design payment is automatically processed 30 days after the initial deposit date. Any client that stops payment or incurs insufficient funds during the campaign cycle owes the remaining balance of the agreement to Mr. Adpilot and all 3rd parties involved such as Google, Bing and Facebook prior to cancellation of agreement. FULL payment of new website designs are due within thirty (30) days from date of the signed agreement. During the website design process, there is a revision stage of fourteen (14) days. If there is no communication or lack of communication from the client after the fourteen (14) day revision stage, FULL website payment will be billed.  Mr. Adpilot reserves the right to place any website “Under Maintenance” and pause services for any accounts receivable that exceed thirty (30) days past due. All outstanding balances must be fully settled before any access points (e.g., website credentials) are transferred to the customer. It is the sole responsibility of the customer to contact Mr. Adpilot to cancel their account.</p>

            <p>IN NO EVENT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NEGLIGENCE, SHALL Mr. Adpilot OR ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, TRUSTEES, AGENTS OR CONTENT OR SERVICE PROVIDERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE PROTECTED ENTITIES) BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM, OR DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY RELATED TO, THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE SITE OR THE CONTENT, MATERIALS AND FUNCTIONS RELATED THERETO, YOUR PROVISION OF INFORMATION VIA THE SITE, LOST BUSINESS OR LOST SALES, EVEN IF SUCH PROTECTED ENTITY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
